# MyDataHelps REST API Python Quickstart

This script is a demonstration of how to access the [MyDataHelps REST API](https://developer.mydatahelps.org/) using Python3. It gives an example of obtaining an access token and making a simple query to the API. You can use this app for reference, or modify it to test out your own API requests in a development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need three things related to your RKStudio account:

* Your RKStudio service account name, like “RKStudio.1234.test.”
* Your RKStudio project ID, which is a GUID.
* The private key you associated with your service account.

For help finding this information, see the [MyDataHelps Developer Docs](https://developer.mydatahelps.org/api/quickstart.html).

You will also need to install the following Python packages (most easily done through the [Python Package Installer](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)):

```
pip install PyJWT
pip install cryptography
pip install requests
pip install python-dotenv
```

or:
- `python -m venv env`
- `env/bin/pip install poetry`
- `env/bin/poetry install`

## Using the App

To run the app:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy the file `dotenv.sample` and name the new copy `.env`.
3. Edit the `.env` file and fill in your project ID, service account name, and private key. See **Prerequisites** above for more information. Be sure to include the begin/end tags “--BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY--“ and “--END RSA PRIVATE KEY--" in your private key.
4. Run the script: `python3 quickstart.py`.

If successful, the app will print out your token and number of participants in the console, like so:

```
Obtained service access token:
  YOUR TOKEN HERE

Total Participants: 5
```

The service access token is only valid for a few minutes, but you can copy/paste it into a REST query tool of your choice to try out advanced queries.

You can also edit the code to specify a participant identifier and get a participant access token for that participant. This token is only needed for [MyDataHelps Embeddables](https://developer.mydatahelps.org/embeddables), and is useful for testing with the [MyDataHelps Starter Kit](https://github.com/CareEvolution/MyDataHelpsStarterKit). 

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error when running the script, double-check the information in the Prerequisites, particularly the format of the private key. It should include the begin/end tags and line breaks, looking something like this:

```
RKS_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n230703de230703de230703de\nb62b0e24b62b0e24b62b0e24\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

If you have trouble getting the app to work, feel free to [contact MyDataHelps Support](https://developer.mydatahelps.org/help.html).
